My code for problem 2 is organized as follows:

(2)
(a) Run hw2a.py. The plot is shown using pyplot.show() so the program will only end when the figure that pops up is closed.
(b) Run hw2b.py. The plot is shown using pyplot.show() so the program will only end when the figure that pops up is closed.
(c) Run hw2c.py. This produces the correct output but takes ~5 minutes to run - Sorry!
I’m 90% sure it’s because I am iterating over l,w for a matrix of size A[l,w,3] instead of just points in A. Whenever I change that though I get weird errors. I’ve put my output image in my pdf for reference as well.
